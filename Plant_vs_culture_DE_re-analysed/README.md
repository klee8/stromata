#### Differential Expression analysis of Plant vs Culture using Fl1_v3 gene set

Re-did the plant vs culture DE analysis from Dupont et al., (2015) using version 3 of the Epichloe Fl1 gene set and the salmon + DESeq pipeline.

Changed orientation of experiment to have culture as the focus and wt stem as the refrence (more easily compared with stromata v stem)

Scripts were setup using config.txt, DESeq2_compare.txt and the generic DE script.
