# Comparative genomics analysis

### AIM: look for presence of core genes from stromata DE analysis in a range of sexual and asexual Epichloe genomes

### DATA: data from Schardl lab, Young lab, Cox and Scott labs

### Workflow

+ Get genes sets from each of the genomes with MAKER (or first step of funnannotate)
+ Use proteinortho5 to identify orthologs
+ Graph presence of stromata genes in each spp
