Epichloe RNA-Seq project, Kate LEE
started March 2019

AIM:
  find differentially expressed transcripts in three different treatments of three different Epichloe-host symbiotic pairs
  identify strain-specific clusters of secondary metabolites (especially those that are down-regulated in stroma)
  see how psudostem expression compares with previous studies
  find core set of genes that are always up/down regulated in stroma
  find changes in the inflorescence vs psudostem (see which of these match stroma changes)

DATA:
  Epichloe - host examples
    Ety_8: Epichloe typhina strain E8 (obligate stromata former)
    Efe_2368: Epichloe festucae strain E2368
    Eel_728: Epichloe elymi strain NFe728

  David Winter's assemblies for each Epichloe strain
    masked fasta file
    gff3 files
    annotations text files
    protein fasta file
    trascript fasta files

  Epichloe illumina runs listed in stroma_files.csv
