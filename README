Epichloe RNA-Seq project, Kate LEE
started March 2019

AIM:
  find differentially expressed transcripts in three different treatments of three different Epichloe-host symbiotic pairs
  identify strain-specific clusters of secondary metabolites (especially those that are down-regulated in stroma)
  see how psudostem expression compares with previous studies
  find core set of genes that are always up/down regulated in stroma
  find changes in the inflorescence vs psudostem (see which of these match stroma changes)

DATA:
  Epichloe - host samples
    Ety_8: Epichloe typhina strain E8 (obligate stromata former)
    Efe_2368: Epichloe festucae strain E2368
    Eel_728: Epichloe elymi strain NFe728

  David Winter's assemblies for each Epichloe strain
    masked fasta file (genome)
    gff3 files
    annotations text files
    protein fasta file
    trascript fasta files (transcriptome)

  Epichloe illumina runs listed in stroma_files.csv


PIPELINE:
  0_raw_data (mostly held in /opt/ due to space issues)
  1_QC      initially tried SolexQC, but found this missed illumina adapters which were still on the threads
            ran fastQC on all files
            trimmomatic used to remove illumina adapters (TruSeq2 SE) and trim < phred 20 (SLIDINGWINDOW:5:20)
            re-ran fastQC on trimmed files to check them
  2_STAR    initially ran STAR against genome (found some new junctions). New splicing is not of interest so abandoned this.
            Ran STAR against transcriptome (Salmon can also do this, but it seems better to do this with a
            full read mapping algorithm and extract Epichloe reads first to minimise possibility of getting contaminant reads)
  3_Salmon  random order bam file needed for use in Salmon (can randomise with samtools collate (orders by read name i.e. not in genome position order))
            mapped bam files are not in positional order, use as they are. Salmon needs reads mapped to transcriptome. convert bam to fastq
            Quant-map
