#### Ryegrass differential expression analysis

Used 45K gene set for Lolium perenne from Dupont et al., (2015) to do a differential expression analysis of ryegrass genes from the stromata project using salmon and DESeq pipelines.

Scripts were set up using config.txt, DESeq2_compare.txt and the generic DE pipeline setup.
